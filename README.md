# craftsman star

<h4>By porting textures from many higher version mods into one texture pack, </h4>
<h4>players of version 1.12.2 no longer need to download other higher version texture packs, Because downloading too many texture packs makes it messy when adding texture packs.</h4>

## Differences from other mods texture porting packages

<h4>Modified to be more compatible with higher version textures, integrating more textures.</h4>
<h4>Craftsman Star will merge with other functional, practical, and aesthetically pleasing resource packs.</h4>
<h4>Embracing the Minecraft 1.12.2 community and maintaining it extremely well
That's why the craftsman star program was created in the first place.</h4>
